# DecentBackupSystem
A system for offsite automatic backups designed for use with BitTorrent Sync (https://www.getsync.com/), and client/server software.

The main reasoning for using Bit Torrent Sync as the medium for transfer is that it does not require any IP's; Once the folders are tied together, the system will take care of the rest.
